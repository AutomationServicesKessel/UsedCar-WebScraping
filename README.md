# UsedCar-WebScraping
A project to collect data about used vehicle listings. The data is scraped from used vehicle websites and stored locally. 

"SiteScraper REV B.py" runs the task of scanning the first 20 pages of the given website once.
"Scheduler.py" is used to run the "Sitescraper REV B.py" script multiple times. 
"CarData.csv" is an example data file, which will automatically be appended by running the code.
